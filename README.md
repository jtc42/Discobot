## Why?

In 2023 Spotify launched their [new feed design](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-03-08/new-home-page-scroll-clips-previews/), to [almost universal dislike](https://piunikaweb.com/2023/04/14/new-spotify-home-page-ui-on-android-and-ios-faces-backlash/). Almost.

Turns out I quite like it, which is particularly funny because I don't really use Spotify much. I generally prefer Apple Music.

Discobot is essentially a standalone app providing something a bit like the new Spotify feed, but based on your Apple Music recommendations. It provides previews of albums and playlists as you scroll, and allows you to quickly open or start playing items in the Apple Music app.

## Features

* Supports albums and playlists from your Apple Music personal recommendations
* Plays previews from the iTunes store as you scroll
* Integrates with the Apple Music app and player
* Animated card backgrounds for the aesthetic
